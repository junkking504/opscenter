# OpsCenter workspace instructions

Start with [docs/Home.md](docs/Home.md). It is the canonical human and agent
index for OpsCenter source, architecture, integrations, runtime boundaries,
sharing, and historical context.

## Source and deployment boundary

- Edit source in a Git checkout or task worktree based on the intended commit.
- Never edit `/Users/missioncontrol/opscenter-v2/opscenter`; it is the active
  immutable-production symlink.
- Never edit `/Users/missioncontrol/opscenter-v2/opscenter-preview`; it is the
  preview symlink.
- Follow [deploy/macmini/README.md](deploy/macmini/README.md) for delivery.
- A release, service-health check, and authenticated browser check are separate
  evidence. Do not claim production changed until all required checks pass.

## Runtime boundary

OpsCenter intentionally keeps runtime state outside Git:

- OpsBot collectors and authoritative data:
  `/Users/missioncontrol/.openclaw/workspace/opsbot`
- Protected environment and Slack configuration:
  `/Users/missioncontrol/Library/Application Support/OpsCenter`
- Logs: `/Users/missioncontrol/Library/Logs/OpsCenter`
- Browser profiles, Keychain values, databases, and launchd state remain local.

Do not copy credentials, cookies, tokens, customer records, employee payroll,
financial exports, raw telemetry, logs, or live runtime data into this
repository or a Business share bundle.

## Documentation

Update the relevant document in `docs/` when changing architecture,
integrations, source precedence, deployment, operational safety, or the asset
map. Prefer links to one canonical document over duplicated instructions.
